			need to break walls from a diff direction, or use key to unlock path from other way

	trap level - bastion
		spinning wheel with turrets attached to it
		pew pew laser beams from space tether

todo: diff particles for key being used up - burst key color particles?
	particles when bullet hits wall
		they shoot out in narrow cone at opposite angle of bullet
